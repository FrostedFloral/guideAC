Idea:
Want to learn ReactJS and going to do that by creaing a guide of sorts for Animal Crossing: New Leaf (shortning to AC) for the Nintendo 3DS

Lead up:
I've already got a hand on node.js and using JSX. I've scratched the surface on creating a React app.
I'm going to use gitbash to post my repo as a go along.
I've had many years of playing AC and have recently started over. I have a new character and town, but have brought my furinutre catalog over so I wouldn't have to start all that from scratch. I want to know what I have already and what I'll need for the future as I casually play.

Things to consider:
some dataset where I can grab info from, in this case, AC's catalog.
	Does one exist already on web?
I really would love that job, and in relation, more time to really put my all into this. I'll fight this fight as much as I can.
